Hi! I'm currently a PhD student at [CMU MLD](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/). My advisor is Zachary Lipton.

## Research

My research interest is broadly in multi-agent learning, and machine learning settings involving multiple players and/or models with agency. These days I'm particularly excited by agents!
